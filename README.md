# NASA & Weather APIs Project
## Intro
I designed this web app for my Using APIs module at HackYourFuture. It fetches data from three sources. First of all, if allowed by the user, the app will access the user's location and fetch the weather data for the user from openweathermap. Secondly, it fetches the Picture of the Day from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API. Lastly, we can access NASA's database for images related to any search word the user may have. Including videos in the search result is optional.
The web version of this project can be seen [here](https://nidaulzafar.github.io/api-project/)
