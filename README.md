## About the Project
I designed this web app for my project during the Using APIs module at HackYourFuture journey of learning web development. 
The web version of this project can be seen [here](https://nidaulzafar.github.io/api-project/).

The app fetches data from three sources.
* First of all, if allowed by the user, the app will access the user's location and fetch the weather data for the user from openweathermap. 
* Secondly, it fetches the Picture of the Day from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API. 
* Lastly, we can access NASA's database for images related to any search word the user may have. Including videos in the search result is optional.

Foreseeable errors like location access denied, failing to fetch data and unavailable data are handled such that the user can see on the screen what went wrong.


### Built With

The app was built using the knowledge gained by studying different modules of HTML HackYourFuture curriculum especially:
